A simple portfolio plugin using custom post types and MixItUp sorting developed for themes by Rescue Themes.

=== Description ===

This portfolio plugin is designed to work with themes by Rescue Themes. If your theme is using the Zurb Foundation framework, it's also responsive. You're welcome to use it with other themes but you may need to fiddle with the styling.

When activated, this plugin adds a custom post type called 'Portfolio' to your WordPress dashboard. The custom post will allow you to create sorting categories for your portfolio posts. On the front end, it will display the featured image, title, and excerpt for each individual portfolio post.

=== Installation ===

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new page (a 'Full Width' page works best), naming it whatever you'd like (ex. Gallery)
4. Paste the portfolio's shortcode in that page's content area. The shortcode is [rescue_portfolio]
5. Create portfolio posts under 'Portfolio > Add Item' with a featured image, title, excerpt and away you go!

=== Frequently Asked Questions ===

= Should I display the portfolio with a shortcode? =
